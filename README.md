# MiniTuber

A streaming overlay that helps express yourself and engage with your audiance.
Windows only.

- Control your mini and emote to what's on screen. Punch that NPC you hate or kiss your fav.
- Draw on the screen to get help with puzzles or to troll your chat.
- Use the notebook to help solve mysteries or keep a tally of which NPC lets you die the most so you can have your revenge.

### Guide (WIP)

MiniTuber is always ontop and click through unless certain features are active (miniTuber, chalk, settings menu).
Notebook and Models are saved in your appdata folder. (ex: Roaming\Godot\app_userdata\MiniTuber)

You can drag the menu around so it won't block your game or video. OBS does not capture the emote menu.
