# MiniTuber

A streaming overlay that helps express yourself and engage with your audiance.


- Control your mini and emote to what's on screen. Punch that NPC you hate or kiss your fav.
- Draw on the screen to get help with puzzles or to troll your chat.
- Use the notebook to help solve mysteries or keep a tally of which NPC lets you die the most so you can have your revenge.

Windows only. I'm still *very new* to programming so expect bugs and ugly code lol.

### Guide (WIP)

MiniTuber is always ontop and click through unless certain features are active (miniTuber, chalk, settings menu).
Notebook and Models are saved in your appdata folder. (ex: Roaming\Godot\app_userdata\MiniTuber)

Select which features, models, or notebook you'd like to open at start up and the ability to change inputs.

A red bar pops up when the miniTuber is active. You can only move your mini around when it's active. OBS does not capture the emote menu allowing for viewer immersion.
You can drag the menu around so it won't block your game or video.

Editor to customize your miniTuber. You can also put QR codes for your shops.
